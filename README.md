> ### FLAG
learning data structure step by step

> ### BRIEF
Basic data structure and algorithm will be contained. Of course, I will add more data structures and other algorithm gradually.However, no algorithm problems appear at the project. After finish the project, another project which is about leetcode or other problem solution will be build. Thank you for staring.
